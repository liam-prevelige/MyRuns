This repository contains the code for the Android application MyRuns, a platform to track and store
your workouts! Sign in or register a new account to get started.

On the main page, select your fitness activity or set to automatic detection. Track your movements
and key data - velocity, altitude, distance, etc. - in real time. Once you have completed your
exercise, end the session to store your exercise information in the 'history' panel.

Change units, privacy settings, and update your profile in the settings page.
